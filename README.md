# 👋 Hey there! I'm Muhannad – Welcome to My Portfolio 🚀

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website – a little corner of the internet where I showcase who I am, what I’ve built, and what I’m passionate about. It’s designed to be clean, simple, and easy to navigate — just like I believe good work should be.

🌍 **Live site:** [muhannad7usam.github.io/PORTFOLIO](https://muhannad7usam.github.io/PORTFOLIO/)
